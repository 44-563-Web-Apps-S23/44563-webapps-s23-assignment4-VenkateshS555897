    <h3>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS BY</h3>
    <h4>Authon HERMANN SUDERMANN</h4> 
    <p>HERMANN SUDERMANN

        Hermann Sudermann, one of the foremost of the Continental European
        dramatists, was born at Matziken, in East Prussia, Germany, September
        30, 1857. He attended school at Elbing and Tilsit, and then at fourteen
        became a druggist's apprentice. He received his university training at
        Königsberg and Berlin. Soon he devoted his energies to literary work.

        STRÜBEL. Good day, everybody.

        FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Sarcastically._] Charming day.

        STRÜBEL. [_Surprised at her coolness._] I say! What's up? Who's been
        rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer, anyway? Glass of
        beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please. [_Sits
        down._] Pestiferously hot this afternoon.

        FRAU LINDEMANN. [_After a pause._] H'm, H'm.

        STRÜBEL. Landlady Linda, dear, why so quiet to-day?

        FRAU LINDEMANN. In the first place, Herr Strübel, I would have you know
        that my name is Frau Lindemann.

        STRÜBEL. Just so.

        FRAU LINDEMANN. And, secondly, if you don't stop your familiarity----

        STRÜBEL. [_Singing, as_ ROSA _brings him a glass of beer_.]
        "Beer--beer!"--Heavens and earth, how hot it is! [_Drinks._

        FRAU LINDEMANN. If you find it so hot, why don't you stay quietly down
        there at the Springs?

        STRÜBEL. Ah, my soul thirsts for the heights--my soul thirsts for the
        heights every afternoon. Just as soon as ever my sallow-faced pupil has
        thrown himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to
        grow, "I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved."

        FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Scornfully._] Bah!

        STRÜBEL. Oh, you're thinking that _you_ are my beloved? No, dearest; my
        beloved stays down there. But to get nearer to her, I have to come up
        here--up to your telescope. With the aid of your telescope I can look
        right into her window--see?

        ROSA. [_Laughing._] Oh, so that's why
        LIDDY. It has disappeared now.

        FRAU V. HALLDORF. Are you quite sure that it was a royal carriage?
        
        LIDDY. Oh, one has an instinct for that sort of thing, mother. It comes
        to one in the cradle.
        
        FRAU V. HALLDORF. [_As_ MILLY _yawns and sighs aloud_.] Are you sleepy,
        dear?
        
        MILLY. No, only tired. I'm always tired.</p>
